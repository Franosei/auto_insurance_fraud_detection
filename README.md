# auto_insurance_fraud_detection
Insurance fraud encompasses a wide range of illegal behaviors that an individual may engage in order to obtain a favorable outcome from an insurance company. Inflating claims, misrepresenting
information on an insurance application, submitting claims for injuries or damage that never occurred, and staging accidents are the most common types of insurance fraud. This study proposes
a framework for fraud detection in the auto insurance industry by using machine learning models.
The data was cleaned before modeling, and exploratory data analysis was performed. Following
that, the data was preprocessed for modeling. Three predictive models (random forest, stochastic
gradient boosting, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)) are applied to develop a fraud detection mechanism. The models were evaluated, and the best-fit model was selected using the F1
score, kappa, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The results reveal that the XGBoost outperforms
all the other models in terms of all the metrics used. The studyâ€™s findings are useful for detecting
fraud in the auto insurance business.
